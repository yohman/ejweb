The **Inland Empire Environmental Maproom** is a web-based mapping platform designed to highlight the environmental vulnerabilities impacting California's Inland Empire—a region burdened by the intersection of rapid urban development, heavy industrial activity, and systemic inequities.

The Inland Empire serves as a critical hub for California's logistics and transportation industries, with sprawling warehouses, truck depots, and major highways crisscrossing the region. These human-made elements contribute significantly to pollution, degraded air quality, and other environmental challenges. The consequences of these pressures disproportionately affect minority communities and vulnerable populations, exacerbating health disparities and perpetuating environmental injustice.

Visit the **[Maproom](./maproom/index.html)** to explore interactive data visualizations of these environmental challenges.

This platform visualizes data on pollution sources, air quality indices, and other environmental stressors to provide a comprehensive view of the challenges facing the region. By illuminating these realities, the Maproom fosters awareness and empowers individuals, organizations, and policymakers to take actionable steps toward meaningful change.

## **Key Objectives of the Maproom**
1. **Highlight Disparities**: Visualize how environmental stressors—like poor air quality and hazardous pollutants—disproportionately impact marginalized communities.
2. **Empower Communities**: Provide accessible data to support advocacy, education, and informed decision-making.
3. **Call to Action**: Inspire collaborative efforts to address these vulnerabilities through sustainable urban planning, reduced emissions, and equitable policies.
