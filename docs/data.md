# **Data**

The data presented in this platform is sourced from credible and publicly available datasets. Below are the details about the key data sources used:

## **1. [CalEnviroScreen](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen)**
A screening tool developed by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) to identify communities most affected by pollution and environmental hazards.

## **2. Warehouse Data**
The warehouse data was obtained from **[Warehouse CITY](https://www.warehousecity.org)**, an open data product used to visualize and quantify the cumulative impact of warehouses within Southern California. Community groups, researchers, planners, and local agencies apply this open data product in project approval processes, research, lawsuits, and education. Warehouse CITY estimates the cumulative impacts of:

- Warehouse counts
- Acreage
- Building footprint
- Heavy-duty truck trips
- Diesel particulate matter emissions
- Oxides of nitrogen emissions
- Carbon dioxide emissions
- Jobs

The Warehouse CITY open data product and dashboard is available as a **[website](https://www.warehousecity.org)** and at a **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/warehousecity)**.

## **3. GeoJSON Data Files**
The following GeoJSON data files are used in the Maproom visualizations:

- **[Warehouse Points](./maproom/data/warehouse_points.geojson)**
- **[Water Data](./maproom/data/water.geojson)**
- **[CalEnviroScreen Data](./maproom/data/calenviroscreen.geojson)**
